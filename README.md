# Visualizing INRs of Shapes

This repository contains codes for visualizing implicit nerual representations (INRs) of 3D shapes, specifically point clouds, meshes and voxels. 

In the following sections, I will provide a step-by-step guide for utilizing this repository effectiely.

The code contained in this repository has been tested on ubuntu 22.04 with python 3.8.6.

## Setup

The setup necessary for running the codes within this repository, follows the same procedure found in [CVlab official **inr2vec** repository](https://github.com/CVLAB-Unibo/inr2vec).
